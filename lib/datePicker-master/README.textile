h1. Yet Another Datepicker

An attempt at writing a flexible, framework free, feature-rich and accessible datepicker.

h2. At a glance...

* Keyboard shortcuts adhere to "The DHTML Style Guide Working Group (DSGWG) recommendations":http://access.aol.com/dhtml-style-guide-working-group/#datepicker
* Accessibility enhancements including support for ARIA Roles and States
* The script can parse and format dates using a subset of the "PHP date":http://www.php.net/date/ conversion specifiers
* Both upper and lower date limits can be set
* Bespoke days of the week can be disabled
* Bespoke dates can be disabled/enabled and "*" wildcards used to stipulate the dates in question
* Bespoke days of the week can be highlighted
* Works with any combination of text inputs or select lists
* DOM friendly - the datepicker is only added to the DOM when actually required
* Includes a "smart localisation" option and has been translated into many languages
* Can display an optional status bar and week numbers
* Can be dragged within the viewport by the user
* Global configuration parameters can be specified using JSON within the script tag itself
* The "button" used for popup datepickers can now be styled for default, hover, focus, active and disabled states, be arbitrarily positioned within the DOM and removed from the document tabindex if so desired
* Inline datepickers are now available, are automatically added to the document tabindex and can be arbitrarily positioned within the DOM
* A bespoke final opacity can be defined and if desired, the fade in/out animation effect disabled
* The entire U.I. grid can now be filled with dates
* The "Today" button can be removed from the U.I.
* Fully skinnable with CSS
* Compatible down to IE6
